# Hardware

This project targets **low-cost, field-practical** hardware that can run locally.

## Reference builds
### Low cost prototype
- Raspberry Pi 4/5
- 1–2 USB cameras (UVC) or 1 PoE camera (RTSP)
- Powered speaker + strobe
- Optional isolated jobsite router

### “Site ready” edge box
- NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano / Orin NX
- 1–4 PoE IP cameras
- PoE switch
- Rugged case + cable strain relief

## Camera guidance (MVP)
- Prefer fixed mounts and stable reference points.
- Prioritize **clear view of car path** over aesthetics.
- Avoid glare/reflections; test in the actual lighting conditions.
- Validate that motion in each ROI is reliably visible.
