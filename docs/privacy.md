# Privacy

## Default posture
- **Local-only** operation by default
- **No recording** by default
- **No cloud upload** by default

## Recorded video (if enabled)
Treat all jobsite footage as sensitive:
- Minimize retention
- Restrict access
- Document who can enable recording and why

## Suggested policy
If you are deploying at an organization, write down:
- When recording is allowed
- How long it is retained
- Where it is stored
- Who can access it
