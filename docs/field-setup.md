# Field setup

## Setup checklist
- **Mount camera** with a stable reference and good view of the car path.
- **Confirm lighting**: test worst-case lighting for the job.
- **Define zones**: car path, counterweight path (if visible), pit, overhead, access points.
- **Configure alerts**: audible + strobe (if available), plus local notifications if used.

## Validation (must-do)
- Trigger motion in each ROI and verify alert behavior.
- Verify “camera offline” alert (disconnect/reconnect).
- Verify time sync if recording is enabled.

## Operating notes
- Re-validate after any camera bump, lens cleaning, or lighting change.
