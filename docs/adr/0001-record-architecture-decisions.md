# ADR 0001: Record architecture decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As the project grows, we need a lightweight way to explain why key choices were made (interfaces, storage, detection approach, etc.).

## Decision
We will maintain short Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `docs/adr/`.

## Consequences
- Design intent is preserved over time.
- New contributors can understand tradeoffs faster.
