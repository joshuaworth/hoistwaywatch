# Installation (prototype → jobsite)

This repo is currently scaffolding-first. As code lands, this doc will be updated with concrete commands.

## Prototype (single camera)
- Connect a USB camera or configure an RTSP stream
- Bring up the local dashboard
- Define zones
- Verify: motion in zone triggers an alert

## Jobsite prototype checklist
- Isolated local network (optional but recommended)
- Fixed camera placement
- Audible + visual alerting
- Clear “camera offline” behavior
- Validate at start of shift and after any camera movement
