# FAQ

## Is this a safety interlock?
No. HoistwayWatch is an **awareness layer** (visibility + alerts).

## Does it require cloud access?
No. The default posture is **local-only**. Any centralized logging should be opt-in.

## What if detection fails?
The system must remain useful via **continuous visibility**, explicit “camera offline” state, and explainable alerting when signals are present.

## Can it integrate with elevator controllers?
Not for the MVP. Vendor-neutral, non-invasive approaches are preferred.
