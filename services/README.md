# Services

Back-end components live here. Each service should be able to run locally and communicate via well-defined events/interfaces.

- `capture/`: camera ingest + health
- `vision/`: motion primitives + optional local detection
- `rules/`: deterministic rule evaluation + explanations
- `alerts/`: siren/strobe/notifications + durable log
