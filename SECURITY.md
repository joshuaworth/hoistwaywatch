# Security policy

HoistwayWatch is early-stage. Please treat any installation as a prototype and use appropriate operational controls.

- Instead, email the maintainers (or open a GitHub private security advisory if enabled).

## What to include
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)
- Affected versions/commits
- Any mitigations you recommend
